# Water Quality Prediction

Water is used in our Day to Day activities and Drinking is one of the things we use Water for.

In this survey, we've written a Model that Predicts the Quality of Water using some values.
These values are <b style="color:red">pH, Hardness, Solids, Chrolamines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes and Turbidity</b>.
<h3>The following are the Expanation of these Parameters</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>pH: </b> pH, full meaning Pondos de Hydronium (Power of Hydrogen). pH is the Degree of Acidity or Alkanility of Water.
        The Range of pH goes from 0 - 14; pH of less than 7 indicates Acidity, greater than 7 denotes Alkalinity denotes Alkalinity and exactly 7 denotes Neutral.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Hardness: </b>Hard water is water that has high mineral content. Hardness of water simply means the amount of dissolved Calcium and magnesium in water.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Solids</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Chrolamines: </b>these are a group of chemical compounds that contain Chlorine and Ammonia
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Sulfate: </b>Sulfate is a naturally occuring compound consisting of a single Sulfur ion and four Oxygen ions $SO_{4}^{-1}$
    </li>
    <li>
        <b> Conductivity: </b>this is a measure of the capability of water to pass electrical flow.
     </li>
    <li>
        <b>Organic Carbon: </b> this is a measure of total amount of Carbon in Organic Compounds in Pure water and aqeous systems.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Trihalomethanes: </b>are results of a reaction between the chlorine used for disinfecting tap water and natural organic matter in the water.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Turbidity: </b>This is caused by particles suspended in water that scatter light, making the water appear cloudy or Murky
    </li>
</ul>
